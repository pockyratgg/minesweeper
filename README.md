 Minesweeper created using javascript/css/html

Project completed in January 2024

This was my most complicated project to work on at the time, and took a little over a month to complete and iron out all the bugs!

Challenges that were run into: 

Changing the win condition from marking every bomb as a flag counting as a win to revealing every space that is not a bomb is considered a win

Understanding recursion and working out some bugs where numbers or spaces were displaying or counting bombs incorrectly
